# Task Tracker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development

Every feature begins with a complete, testable specification that defines WHAT and WHY before HOW. Specifications must be validated by non-technical stakeholders and contain no implementation details. All ambiguities must be marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers until resolved through the /clarify command.

**Rationale**: Prevents scope creep, ensures user value is clear, and enables effective planning by separating requirements from implementation decisions.

### II. Contract-Driven Design

API contracts, data models, and interfaces are designed before implementation and validated through contract tests. All external boundaries must have explicit contracts that fail initially and pass only when properly implemented.

**Rationale**: Enables parallel development, catches integration issues early, and ensures consistent interfaces across the system.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Tests are written before implementation in strict TDD cycles: Red (failing tests) → Green (minimal implementation) → Refactor. Implementation tasks cannot begin until corresponding test tasks are complete and failing.

**Rationale**: Ensures code quality, drives better design decisions, provides regression protection, and validates that requirements are testable.

### IV. Structured Workflow Execution

All development follows the prescribed command workflow: /specify → /clarify → /plan → /tasks → /implement → /analyze. Each phase has explicit gates and must complete successfully before proceeding to the next.

**Rationale**: Provides predictable development process, ensures quality gates are respected, and maintains consistency across different features and team members.

### V. Parallel-First Task Design

Tasks that operate on different files or have no dependencies are marked [P] for parallel execution. Task breakdown prioritizes independence to maximize development velocity while respecting dependency chains.

**Rationale**: Reduces development time, allows for distributed work, and encourages modular design patterns.

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality

- All code changes must pass contract tests before integration tests
- Implementation must follow established patterns from existing codebase
- No implementation may skip the failing test requirement
- Linting and formatting standards are enforced at commit time

### Documentation Quality

- All specifications must be stakeholder-readable (no technical jargon)
- Design documents must capture rationale, not just decisions
- Templates must be updated when constitutional principles change
- Agent-specific guidance files must remain current with workflow changes

## Development Workflow

### Phase Gates

Each development phase has mandatory completion criteria:

- **Specification**: All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers resolved
- **Planning**: Constitution check passed, complexity justified
- **Task Generation**: All contracts have tests, dependency order validated
- **Implementation**: All tests pass, integration verified
- **Analysis**: Cross-artifact consistency validated

### Compliance Requirements

- All pull requests must verify constitutional compliance
- Complexity deviations require explicit justification in Complexity Tracking sections
- Template updates must propagate within same development cycle
- Agent guidance must be updated when workflow changes

## Governance

### Amendment Process

Constitutional changes require:

1. Version increment following semantic versioning (MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for additions, PATCH for clarifications)
2. Sync Impact Report documenting all affected templates and files
3. Propagation of changes across all dependent artifacts
4. Validation that no unexplained placeholder tokens remain

### Versioning Policy

- Constitution versions follow semantic versioning
- All templates reference current constitution version
- Breaking changes require migration plan for existing workflows
- Template changes must maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Compliance Review

- Regular validation that templates align with constitutional principles
- Agent-specific guidance files reviewed for generic applicability
- Workflow execution audited against prescribed phase gates
- Quality standards enforced through automated and manual checks
