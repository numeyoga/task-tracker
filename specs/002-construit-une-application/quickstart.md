# Quickstart Guide: Work Time Tracking Web Application

## User Journey Validation Tests

### Test 1: First-Time User Setup
**Scenario**: New user opens the application for the first time

**Steps**:
1. Open application in Chrome browser
2. Verify welcome/setup screen appears
3. Configure daily presence time requirement (default 8 hours)
4. Create first task: "Development Work"
5. Verify task appears in task list
6. Verify no active timer is running

**Expected Results**:
- Clean, modern interface loads without external resources
- Settings are saved to localStorage
- Default presence time is configurable
- Task creation works with validation
- No errors in browser console

### Test 2: Basic Timer Operations
**Scenario**: User starts working and uses basic timer functions

**Steps**:
1. Select "Development Work" task as active
2. Start timer and verify it displays hh:mm:ss format
3. Wait 5 seconds, verify timer updates correctly
4. Stop timer and verify time is recorded
5. Check that accumulated time updates for task
6. Verify arrival time is recorded for the day

**Expected Results**:
- Only one task can be active at a time
- Timer updates every second with precision
- Time is accumulated correctly
- Daily presence tracking starts automatically
- localStorage updates with timer data

### Test 3: Task Switching
**Scenario**: User switches between different work tasks

**Steps**:
1. Create second task: "Meeting Preparation"
2. Start timer on "Development Work"
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Switch to "Meeting Preparation" task
5. Verify previous timer stops and new timer starts
6. Stop second timer
7. Verify both tasks have accumulated time

**Expected Results**:
- Previous timer stops automatically when switching
- New timer starts immediately
- Time is correctly allocated to each task
- Quick task switching works smoothly
- No time overlap between tasks

### Test 4: Meal Break Tracking
**Scenario**: User takes lunch break

**Steps**:
1. Start work timer on any task
2. Start meal break timer
3. Verify meal break timer runs independently
4. Stop meal break after test period
5. Stop work timer
6. Verify meal time is deducted from presence time
7. Check daily summary shows correct working time

**Expected Results**:
- Meal break timer works independently of task timers
- Manual start/stop control for meal breaks
- Meal time correctly deducted from presence calculation
- Daily summary shows: presence time, meal time, working time

### Test 5: Activity Counters
**Scenario**: User tracks non-task activities during the day

**Steps**:
1. Find coffee/break counter buttons
2. Click coffee counter (+1)
3. Click coffee counter again (+1)
4. Click break counter (+1)
5. Verify counters update immediately
6. Check daily summary includes activity counts

**Expected Results**:
- Simple increment counters work (+1 per click)
- Counters update immediately in UI
- Daily summary shows activity totals
- Counters reset daily

### Test 6: Manual Time Correction
**Scenario**: User needs to correct time entry error

**Steps**:
1. Create time entry through normal timer use
2. Access time correction interface
3. Modify duration for specific time entry
4. Add note explaining correction
5. Save correction
6. Verify daily/weekly totals update
7. Verify correction is marked as manual

**Expected Results**:
- Time entries can be edited after creation
- Manual corrections are flagged differently
- Notes can be added to explain corrections
- All totals recalculate correctly
- Audit trail shows manual modifications

### Test 7: Weekly Reporting
**Scenario**: User generates weekly report for external system

**Steps**:
1. Work several days with different tasks
2. Navigate to weekly report view
3. Select current week from dropdown
4. Verify Monday-Friday summary appears
5. Verify time format is hh:mm for accumulated time
6. Verify task breakdown shows total time per task
7. Copy data for external system input

**Expected Results**:
- Weekly view shows Monday-Friday only
- Time totals formatted as hh:mm (not hh:mm:ss)
- Task breakdown clearly shows time allocation
- Data is easy to copy/paste for external systems
- Week selection dropdown works correctly

### Test 8: Data Persistence
**Scenario**: User closes and reopens browser

**Steps**:
1. Start timer on any task
2. Close browser tab/window
3. Reopen application URL
4. Verify all data is restored
5. Verify active task and timer state are restored
6. Continue timer and verify correct time accumulation

**Expected Results**:
- All tasks, settings, and history restored
- Active task state preserved
- Timer continues from where it left off
- No data loss on browser restart
- Performance remains good with accumulated data

### Test 9: Auto-Stop Protection
**Scenario**: Verify timer doesn't run indefinitely

**Steps**:
1. Start timer on any task
2. Modify system to simulate timer running for 12+ hours
3. Verify timer auto-stops at configured maximum
4. Verify user is notified of auto-stop
5. Verify time is capped at maximum duration
6. Test that user can manually restart if needed

**Expected Results**:
- Timer stops automatically at 12-hour limit (configurable)
- User receives notification about auto-stop
- Time entry is marked with reason for stop
- User can adjust settings for maximum duration
- Protection prevents unrealistic time accumulation

### Test 10: Historical Data and Audit
**Scenario**: User reviews historical work patterns

**Steps**:
1. Work for several days with various tasks
