# Feature Specification: Work Time Tracking Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `002-construit-une-application`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Construit une application web front uniquement qui me permet de suivre les heures que j'ai pass� au travail et sur quoi j'ai travaill�..."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A worker needs to track their daily work hours and activities through a modern web application. They arrive at work, start the app, track different tasks throughout the day with timers, record breaks and meals, and at the end of the week generate reports to input into their company's time tracking system. The app persists data locally and provides comprehensive weekly summaries.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user opens the app in the morning, **When** they start their workday, **Then** the system records their arrival time and allows task selection
2. **Given** the user is working on a task, **When** they start the timer, **Then** the timer displays running time in hh:mm:ss format and tracks time for that task
3. **Given** the user needs to switch tasks, **When** they select a different active task, **Then** the previous timer stops and the new task timer begins
4. **Given** the user made a time entry error, **When** they manually adjust time for any task on any day, **Then** the correction is applied and reflected in daily/weekly totals
5. **Given** it's end of week, **When** the user views the weekly summary, **Then** they see time totals per task (hh:mm format) for Monday-Friday to copy into external systems
6. **Given** the user closes the browser, **When** they reopen the app later, **Then** all data is restored including active task and accumulated time

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user forgets to stop a timer overnight?
- How does the system handle timer precision when switching between tasks rapidly?
- What happens if the user's computer goes to sleep while a timer is running?
- How are lunch breaks and coffee breaks differentiated in the tracking?
- What happens when viewing data for weeks that don't have a full Monday-Friday schedule?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: How should meal time be managed? → A: Manual meal timer - user starts/stops meal break timer
- Q: What should happen when timers run overnight or during long periods? → A: Auto-stop timers after configurable maximum (e.g., 12 hours)
- Q: What are the device requirements for this work tracking application? → A: Desktop browser only (PC/Mac)
- Q: What timezone approach should be used? → A: Local browser timezone only
- Q: How should activity counters (coffee, breaks, etc.) be tracked and displayed? → A: Simple increment counters (click to add +1)
- Q: What are the accessibility requirements? → A: Single user application, no accessibility constraints needed
- Q: Which DaisyUI theme should be used? → A: Bumblebee theme

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Time Tracking

- **FR-005**: System MUST support starting/stopping timers for tasks with hh:mm:ss display precision
- **FR-005a**: System MUST auto-stop timers after configurable maximum duration (default 12 hours) to prevent unrealistic accumulation
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow manual time adjustments for any task on any day for error correction
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide manual meal break timer that users can start/stop, with meal time deducted from total presence time

#### Data Management & Persistence
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist all data locally in browser storage
- **FR-009**: System MUST restore active task state and accumulated time after browser restart
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain data for current week plus 4 previous weeks (5 weeks total)

#### Reporting & Analytics
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate weekly summaries (Monday-Friday) with time totals per task
- **FR-013**: System MUST display daily and weekly time cumulations
- **FR-014**: System MUST show daily and weekly presence time totals
- **FR-015**: System MUST format cumulated time as hh:mm and running timers as hh:mm:ss
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide week selection dropdown for viewing different week summaries
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide simple increment counters for coffee breaks, pauses, and other activities (click to add +1)
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide audit view showing all historical data

#### Configuration & Interface
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow configuration of required daily presence time
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide modern, visually attractive interface using DaisyUI Bumblebee theme with no accessibility constraints required
